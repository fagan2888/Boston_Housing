Predicting Boston Housing Prices
--------------------------


This project is part of the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) program from Udacity. You can check my report <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>. Here, I will apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston area to predict the selling price of a new home.
