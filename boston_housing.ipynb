    "Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been written. You will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions for this project. Unless it is requested, do not modify any of the code that has already been included. In this template code, there are four sections which you must complete to successfully produce a prediction with your model. Each section where you will write code is preceded by a **STEP X** header with comments describing what must be done. Please read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer that relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **QUESTION X** header. Be sure that you have carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the text boxes that begin with \"**Answer:**\". Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions.  \n",

This allows you to make edits to the block of text you see here. This block of text (and mostly anything that's not code) is written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which is a way to format text using headers, links, italics, and many other options! Whether you're editing a Markdown text block or a code block (like the one below), you can use the keyboard shortcut **Shift + Enter** or **Shift + Return** to execute the code or text block. In this case, it will show the formatted text.\n",

You'll know the code block executes successfully if the message *\"Boston Housing dataset loaded successfully!\"* is printed."
